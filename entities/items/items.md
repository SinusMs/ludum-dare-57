Story:
door.tscn		"Okay, today is the day. I avoided clearing out his old room for ages and it has kind of become a storage room for all kinds of junk, but today I am finally pushing myself to do it. This is gonna be tough."
bong.tscn		"Some days, he seemed really... absent. I guess this explains some of it. I just hope it didn't do any harm to him."
(diary.tscn)		Diary Entry #93: I went to my first therapy session today. I feel like I opened pandoras box, but I feel somewhat better. I just kept talking and talking and talking and suddenly the time was up. I hadn't been aware I was even able to talk that much. "Huh, he never told me he went to therapy."
gameboy.tscn		"He spent hours staring at that screen. What a pity... Over the years he secluded himself more and more from me by playing video games."

sound_system.tscn	"I could never really get behind the kind of music he listened to."
degree.tscn		"I wish I could have given him more guidance in life, but this computer stuff is just... too much for me. I don't understand anything about it at all."
pizza_cartons.tscn	"All vegetarian, of course. "
letter.tscn		"A scribbled letter, many parts are crossed out or corrected." Dear Dad, it is really hard for me to tell you this, so I am writing you this letter We have become so distant it seems like you don't even know who I am anymore. When we talk about my life, its never about what I want from life, its always about what yout think is best for me. I get it, you wish I was more like you, but I am just not. I really hurts me to not feel supported by my own dad. You don't have to say you're proud. You don't have to hug me. You don't have to say you love me. I understand you're not able to do any of that. Just listen to me and accept who I am. I love you, you're my dad after all, but if things don't change at least by a little, I will move out.

boots.tscn		"All of the hiking tours we did together were so long we both had to push ourselves to our physical limit. We always felt like we were the greatest when we fought through and made it to our destination."
bicycle.tscn		"His old bicycle... We used to spend countless hours riding and tinkering with our bikes. I wonder if he misses that too."
birth_foto.tscn		"It feels like yesterday. I still remember every last detail about that day. The chaos. The worries. The tension. The joy. I wanted to be there and cut the umbilical cord myself, but they hat to perform a C-section. The feeling of relief and pride after it all went well was indescribable."
