# General
Repository for Ludum Dare 57.

Project uses Godot 4.4.1 and is intended for web builds.

The state of the main branch is continously deployed to https://sinusms.github.io/ludum-dare-57/.

# Vision
- Clean up messy Room by clicking on individual items
- more items get reavealed gradually by removing items in the front
- The deeper the player gets into the room by removing items, the absurder the items get
- As in real life, the player gets constantly sidetracked from cleaning up by the stuff he finds (minigames?)
- All items have title + item descriptions
- Story is told very vaguely via item descriptions, gets increasingly dark
